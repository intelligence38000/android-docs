## Intro to contributing

We welcome contributions to this Android documentation repository. Please follow these steps if you're interested in adding to our documentation:

- [Open a ticket](https://github.com/mapbox/android-docs/issues/new) to kick off a conversation, feel free to tag the `@mapbox/android` team. It's a good idea to explain your plans before you push any code to make sure no one else is working on something similar and to discuss the best approaches to tackle your particular idea.
- Create a new branch off of `mb-pages`. This new branch will contain your additions.
- Make the changes you'd like to see in the documentation. As you make changes, don't forget to test the site locally (described above) to see your changes in action.
- Double check. Triple check. Spell check your writing. If you have code snippets, please make sure they're correct as well.
- Finally, once you're ready to share your additions, open a pull request for the `@mapbox/android` team to review. If/once approved, this pull request will pull your changes into the `master` branch of this repository.

## Content types

The Android documentation consists of four distinct content types: Overview guides, Examples, Help resources, and API references. See below for how to contribute each type of content.


### Overview guides

The Overview section contains **technical narrative guides**. Technical narrative guides provide a combination of technical detail, code snippets, and narrative explanation of product-specific concepts.

There are two files that will need to be added or modified for new technical narrative guides: (1) a new Markdown file and (2) modifications to the `batfish.config.js` file.

#### Step one: Markdown file

1. Create a new Markdown file in either `src/pages/maps/overview` for guides about the Maps SDK or `src/pages/navigation/overview` for the Navigation SDK, etc.
2. Add front matter.
  - `title` (required): Name of example in title case.
  - `description` (required): One to two sentence description of the example. Must end in a period.
  - `prependJs` (optional): Things to import to be used in the Markdown file.
3. Write the content of the guide in the Markdown file (outside of the front matter).
  - _Note: Use JSX inside the Markdown file inside of `{{ }}`. See below for an example._

**Example**:

```md
---
title: "Camera"
description: "Information about map camera behavior in the Mapbox Maps SDK for Android. Updating the camera position. Restricting the camera. It's all covered inside."
prependJs:
  - "import { Floater } from '../../../components/floater';"
---

The Maps SDK's maps are represented as a flat plane using a [Mercator projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection). On the east-west-axis, the map seamlessly wraps around on itself an infinite amount of times. Because the bottom and the top of the map could infinitely grow larger and further distort the map towards the poles, the north-south-axis gets cut off around the 90 degrees north and 90 degrees south. With this in mind, the camera object's introduced to represent the user's viewpoint above the map.

...

## Update the camera position

{{
  <Floater
    url="https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-demo/blob/master/MapboxAndroidDemo/src/main/java/com/mapbox/mapboxandroiddemo/examples/camera/AnimateMapCameraActivity.java"
    title="Animate the map camera"
    category="example"
    text="Change the camera target, bearing, zoom, and tilt by animating the camera."
  />
}}

The `MapboxMap` class in the Maps SDK has several methods to change the camera's position. Each camera movement API takes in a `CameraUpdate` (built using `CameraUpdateFactory`) which is how you provide the new camera position information. Camera update factory can build several different `CameraUpdate` objects including a `newLatLngZoom()`, `zoomBy()`, `newLatLngBounds()`, and several more. One particularly interesting `CameraUpdate` is `newCameraPosition()` which is how you'd pass in a built `CameraPosition`.

...
```

#### Step two: batfish.config.js

Any time you add a new overview guide or alter the filename of an overview guide, you will need to modify the `productPageOrder` variable in the `batfish.config.js` file. This is where the table of contents order is determined.

1. Open `batfish.config.js`.
2. Add, alter, or move a string that matches the filename (without the `.md` file extension) of the Overview guide you added/altered _exactly_. These are case-sensitive. The order these appear are the order in which the guides will appear in the table of contents.

#### Code blocks in overview guides

To add a code block for a single language use <code>```</code> followed by the language of the code. For example, here's a Java code block:

<pre>
```java
mapboxMap.addMarker(new MarkerOptions()
  .position(new LatLng(48.85819, 2.29458))
  .title("Eiffel Tower")
```
</pre>

To add a code block that toggles between Java and Kotlin, use a combination of the `CodeLanguageToggle` and `ToggleableCodeBlock` components. First import them into the Markdown file using the following:

```md
prependJs:
  - "import CodeLanguageToggle from '../../../components/code-language-toggle';"
  - "import ToggleableCodeBlock from '../../../components/toggleable-code-block';"
```

Then, in the body of the Markdown file, include these components using JSXtreme Markdown. Here's an example:

```
{{
<CodeLanguageToggle id="markers-code" />
<ToggleableCodeBlock

java={`
mapboxMap.addMarker(new MarkerOptions()
  .position(new LatLng(48.85819, 2.29458))
  .title("Eiffel Tower")
`}

kotlin={`
hi hello
i am kotlin code
üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
`}

/>
}}
```

Language preference (Java vs. Kotlin) will persist throughout /android-docs when navigating between pages.

#### Mapbox Java SDK

All overview guides for APIs in the Mapbox Java SDK should follow this format:

- Intro section
  - Description of what the API does
  - High-level overview of the wrapper and where to find it
  - Any prerequisites (i.e. "Before using this wrapper....")
- API request (with code sample)
- API response (with code sample)
- Other options as necessary

### Examples

The examples section contains **code examples**. Examples are updated by bumping the either the `examples/maps` or `examples/navigation` submodule, based on the code in the [mapbox/mapbox-android-demo](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-demo) or the [mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android) repo. These repos contain working Android projects with apps that integrate the Java or Kotlin examples.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: please refer to this repo's [README.md](https://github.com/mapbox/android-docs/blob/mb-pages/README.md#installation) to make sure you have properly cloned the repo, otherwise the submodule references will not load properly.

#### Update examples
1. Make and commit your changes in the proper repo.
2. `git submodule update --remote examples/maps` (or `examples/navigation`) to update the submodule. This should typically point to the latest commit in master.
3. `git add examples/maps` (or `examples/navigation`) to stage the submodule update.
4. `git commit -m "Bumped examples submodule for <some reason>"``

Each example requires three pieces: (1) a code snippet, (2) visual assets, and (3) a Markdown file.

#### Step one: Code snippet

Code for Android examples comes from public repos that contain completely functional and tested Android apps. There are currently two repos with Android test apps: `/mapbox-android-demo` for the **Maps SDK, Java SDK, Plugins, and Core** and `/mapbox-navigation-android` for the **Navigation SDK**.

1. Create a new example.
2. Open a pull request. A Mapbox team member will pull that code into this repo when the pull request is approved.
3. Create a new JavaScript file src/example-code/ file following the instructions in either the `boilerplate.js` file.

#### Step two: Visual assets

Each example requires two visual assets: (1) a `png` thumbnail and (2) a full-size preview of the final result, which can be either a `png` or an `mp4`.

1. Create visual assets using a physical Android device or an emulated device.
2. Add any pngs to `src/img/src/`.
3. Add any mp4s to `src/video/`.
4. Add a new entry for pngs to the image config ([read more about the image config](#images)).
5. Run `bin/appropriate-images.js --all`.

#### Step three: Markdown file

Adding a new Markdown file to the `src/pages/maps/examples/` folder will add both a new thumbnail on mapbox.com/android-docs/maps/examples/ and create a new individual example pages like mapbox.com/android-docs/maps/examples/*.

1. Create a new Markdown file in `src/pages/maps/examples/` for Maps SDK examples, `src/pages/navigation/examples/` for Navigation SDK examples, etc.
2. Add front matter.
    - `title`: Name of example in title case.
    - `description`: One to two sentence description of the example. Must end in a period.
    - `topic`: Choose from:
        `Getting started`,
        `Dynamic styling`,
        `Data visualization`,
        `3D`,
        `Add markers and infoWindows to the map`,
        `User interaction`,
        `Add features to a map`,
        `Set a map style`,
        `Image generation`,  
        `Offline`
    - `thumbnail`: The image ID from the image config file.
    - `prependJs`:
      - `AppropriateImage` or `VideoWithDeviceFrame` depending on if your full-size preview is a `png` or an `mp4`.
      - `ToggleableCodeBlock` component: Import the component to display your code.
      - Example code: Import the raw and highlighted code pulled in the file you created in `src/example-code/`.
3. The content in the Markdown file (outside of the front matter) will be displayed as text on the individual example page.
4. Add your visual preview using JSX inside `{{ }}` to add an `AppropriateImage` or `VideoWithDeviceFrame`.
5. Add any number of `ToggleableCodeBlock` components and set the `codeSnippet` prop to your imported code.

**Example**:

```md
---
title: Add a hillshade layer
description: Use elevation data to show and customize hills and mountains.
thumbnail: thumbnailAddAHillshadeLayer
topic: Dynamic styling
prependJs:
  - "import AppropriateImage from '../../../components/appropriate-image'"
  - "import ToggleableCodeBlock from '../../../components/toggleable-code-block'"
  - "import { rawJavaCode } from '../../../example-code/HillShadeActivity.js'"
---

{{
  <AppropriateImage
    imageId="exampleAddAHillshadeLayer"
  />
}}

<!-- Any notes about this example would go here.  -->

{{
  <ToggleableCodeBlock
    java={rawJavaCode}
  />
}}
```

_Note: There are not currently any examples written in Kotlin, but they could be added by importing `rawKotlinCode`, adding a `kotlin` prop to the `ToggleableCodeBlock`, and importing and adding a `CodeLanguageToggle`._


### Help

The Help tab contains links to tutorials and troubleshooting guides that live at https://www.mapbox.com/help/.

The links on this page come from `src/data/related-help-pages.js`. To add new links to help guides, add a new object to the `guides` array for the appropriate guide type (tutorials, troubleshooting, etc). The object should follow the pattern of this example:

```json
{
  title: 'First steps with the Mapbox Maps SDK for Android',
  description:
    'Walk through installing the Mapbox Maps SDK for Android, getting a map on the screen, and changing the map style',
  path: 'https://www.mapbox.com/help/first-steps-android-sdk/',
  products: ['maps']
}
```


## Images and videos

### Images

Add images using [appropriate-images](https://github.com/mapbox/appropriate-images) and [appropriate-images-react](https://github.com/mapbox/appropriate-images-react).

General rules:

- Never add raw images directly to the site.
- Never add images directly to `src/img/dist/`.
- Never load images on the site from anywhere *except* `src/img/dist/`.

Follow this process to add a new image:

1. **Add the raw image.** Add the raw image to `src/img/src/` (no subdirectories).

*Note: SVGs belong in `src/svg/`, not in `src/img/`, and have their own processing pipeline.*

2. **Add the new image to the image config**. Specify the sizes you need for each image in `conf/image-config.js`. Check out [the documentation about this file](https://github.com/mapbox/appropriate-images#image-configuration). Here's a sample image configuration item:

```js
industryRealEstateBanner: {
  basename: 'industry-real-estate-header.jpg',
  sizes: [{ width: 500, height: 800 }, { width: 1400 }]
},
```

*Note: `width` is required. `height` is not. `width` and `height` should never exceed the natural dimensions of the image. If `height` is not provided, the natural aspect ratio of the image will be preserved. If `height` is provided, the image will be cropped. By default, it will be center-cropped.*

3. **Run the script.** Run `bin/appropriate-images.js` in terminal, either specifying the image(s) you just added (to save time), or optimizing `--all`. For example, to add only the image in the example above, you would use:

```
bin/appropriate-images.js industryRealEstateBanner
```

*Note: You'll see that the generated images in `src/img/dist/` have filenames corresponding to the sizes you've defined.*

### Videos

Guidelines for videos:

- Must be in the `src/video/` folder.
- Must be in MP4 format.
- Should be recorded from an attached Android device (preferrably on a Pixel 2).
- Must have audio removed.
